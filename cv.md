#### Briefly About Myself:

My interest in programming started a few years ago, when i saw youtube channel of Testing school. I was wondering how software works. And than i took a course in testing. After that i found a job as a  QA engineer in manual testing.
But later i questioned myself how websites work, how developed web-pages, what is frontend and backend.
And i started to learn Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, SQL, etc.
Over the course of three years i took several frontend courses from basic HTML to work with React.


I found out i can learn step by step and things that earlier seemed difficult and unattainable were revealed to me.
It is really fun to create new things and i believe, my passion to creativity will lead me to new skills and new hights in web development.
